# Simplify Voice Training Section

## Goal
Transform the bottom section of the Voice Training onboarding step from a complex card with bullet points and explanations into a simplified single button with explanatory text above it.

## Current Implementation Analysis
Currently, the Voice Training step shows:
1. A card titled "Train Your AI Voice" with description "Create a personalized AI model that writes replies in your style"
2. A detailed explanation section with bullet points about what training will create
3. A "Train My Voice" button at the bottom

## Plan

### Task 1: Simplify the Voice Training Card
- Remove the detailed bullet point explanations in the muted box
- Replace the complex card layout with a simple explanatory text paragraph
- Keep the single "Train My Voice" button as the main call-to-action

### Task 2: Update the explanatory text
- Add clear text above the button explaining that the analysis will be used to craft replies in the user's tone and style
- Make the text concise but informative about the purpose

### Task 3: Maintain existing functionality
- Keep all the existing logic for voice training
- Ensure the button behavior remains unchanged
- Preserve loading states and completion handling

## Implementation Details
The change will be made in the `components/onboarding/voice-training-step.tsx` file, specifically in the second Card component (lines 315-356) that handles the "Train Your AI Voice" section.

## Expected Outcome
A cleaner, more streamlined interface that reduces cognitive load while maintaining the same functionality and clearly explaining the purpose of the voice training feature.
